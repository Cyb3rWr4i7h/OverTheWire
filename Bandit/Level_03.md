## Writeup
Since the password is stored in a file in inhere directory, we will go to inhere directory using <kbd>cd</kbd> ( Change Directory) command.
```bash
cd inhere
```
Now to list all the files including hidden files we will use <kbd>-a</kbd> switch along with <kbd>ls</kbd>
```bash
ls -a
```
In linux OS, hidden file's name begins with a "."
To print the content of <kbd>.hidden</kbd>:
```bash
cat .hidden
```
