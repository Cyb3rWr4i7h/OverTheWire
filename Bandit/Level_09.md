# Bandit Level 9 â†’ Level 10

## Writeup
To get all the strings present in a file, we can use `strings` command, then we can simply `grep` the lines starting from `==` (Since it mentions several "=" characters, it would have at least two to rule out some extra lines ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž)

```bash
strings data.txt | grep ^==
```
